# Operating-Systems---Assignment-1

## Overview

This project involves multiple shell scripting tasks related to file handling, process management, and system operations. The assignment consists of five questions, each requiring a different scripting approach to solve common operating system challenges.

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Prime Number Checker & File Logging

Accepts n integers from the user.

Checks if numbers between 10 and 100 are prime.

Prints a message if a number is prime; otherwise, appends it to first_bash.txt.

Appends the Linux username and timestamp to the file.

### 2. Batch File Operations

Redirects script output to second_bash.txt.

Creates and navigates into Assignment_workdir.

Copies assignment_data.txt to the new directory.

Stores specific file contents and variables in second_bash.txt.

### 3. Interactive Menu-Based Script

Uses switch (not if-else) to handle user input.

Includes options for:

Viewing and inverting file permissions.

Searching for patterns in a file.

Extracting and appending content from multiple files.

Checking and updating file modification timestamps.

### 4. Safe File Deletion Script

Implements a safe_rm command.

Ensures files are backed up in a trash directory before deletion.

Validates correct command usage to prevent unintended deletions.

### 5. Pattern Generator

Generates different patterns based on user-provided parameters.

Handles errors for invalid input values.

## Requirements

Must be implemented in Bash scripting.

Requires a Linux environment with shell access.

Ensure scripts follow proper coding conventions (indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments).
